30isj miniutes a  day so far for a week.

In this mini project I will be demonstrating the very basics of creating an html file for a web page. I have cloned a newly madegit repository via 'git clone' command and using the SSH option. git is a version control system, via git and github i will be saving my code as i go along - I will also be using another system ( home pc) to code the same projectto get use to github more.

I will demonstrate the use of several elements for specific tasks such as the anchor element to create links or list elements to create ordered and unordered lists and few other things.

I must keep in mind to double check that my attributes are all correct for each element. Also in VScode, as I write the initial html code, it is good practice to write out the boilerplate(? not sure if this is correct) or the head element of the code, which will hold all the meta data of the page.
