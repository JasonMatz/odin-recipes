    <p>It's a stake, it doesn't need describing other than it is full of nutrients and tastes amazing :)</p>

    <h2> Medium Ribeye stake</h3>
    
    <p1>Ribeye is very easy to cook. Depending on the thickeness 
        you willusually cook 3 minutes on oneside and 3 on the other.
        Dependingon the fat content you can switch the sides every few minutes 
        but that tends to makeit more towards the rare side.
